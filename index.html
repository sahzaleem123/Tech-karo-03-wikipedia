        <p><strong>Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria</strong>(/ˈɛskəbɑːr/, Spanish: [ˈpaβlo eˈmiljo eskoˈβaɾ ɣaˈβiɾja]; 1
            December 1949 – 2 December 1993) was a Colombian drug lord and narcoterrorist. His cartel supplied an
            estimated 80% of the cocaine smuggled into the United States at the height of his career, turning over
            US$21.9 billion a year in personal income.[2][3] He was often called <strong>"The King of Cocaine"</strong>"
            and was the wealthiest criminal in history, with an estimated known net worth of between US$25 and US$30
            billion by the early 1990s (equivalent to between about $48.5 and $58 billion as of 2018),[4][5] making him
            one of the richest men in the world in his prime. </p>
        <p>Escobar was born in Rionegro, Colombia, and grew up in nearby Medellín, studying briefly at Universidad
            Autónoma Latinoamericana of Medellin but left without a degree. He began to engage in criminal activity
            involving the sale of contraband cigarettes and fake lottery tickets, and also participated in motor vehicle
            theft. In the 1970s, he began to work for various contraband smugglers, often kidnapping and holding people
            for ransom before beginning to distribute powder cocaine himself, as well as establishing the first
            smuggling routes into the United States in 1975. His infiltration to the drug market of the U.S. expanded
            exponentially due to the rising demand for cocaine; and, by the 1980s, it was estimated that 70 to 80 tons
            of cocaine were being shipped from Colombia to the U.S. monthly. His drug network was commonly known as the
            Medellín Cartel, which often competed with rival cartels domestically and abroad, resulting in massacres and
            the murders of police officers, judges, locals, and prominent politicians.</p>
        <p>In 1982 parliamentary election, Escobar was elected as an alternate member of the Chamber of Representatives
            of Colombia as part of the Liberal Alternative movement. Through this, he was responsible for the
            construction of houses and football fields in western Colombia, which gained him popularity among the locals
            of the towns that he frequented. However, Colombia became the "murder capital of the world", and Escobar was
            vilified by the Colombian and American governments.[8] In 1993, Escobar was shot and killed in his hometown
            by Colombian National Police, one day after his 44th birthday.</p>

        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria was born on 1 December 1949, in Rionegro, in the Antioquia Department of
            Colombia. He was the third of seven children of the farmer Abel de Jesús Dari Escobar Echeverri
            (1910–2001),[11] with his wife Hemilda de los Dolores Gaviria Berrío (d. 2006),[12] an elementary school
            teacher.[13] Raised in the nearby city of Medellín, Escobar is thought to have begun his criminal career as
            a teenager, allegedly stealing gravestones and sanding them down for resale to local smugglers. His brother,
            Roberto Escobar, denies this, instead claiming that the gravestones came from cemetery owners whose clients
            had stopped paying for site care, and that he had a relative who had a monuments business.[14] Escobar's
            son, Sebastián Marroquín, claims his father's foray into crime began with a successful practice of selling
            counterfeit high school diplomas,[7] generally counterfeiting those awarded by the Universidad Autónoma
            Latinoamericana of Medellín. Escobar studied at the University for a short period, but left without
            obtaining a degree.</p>
        <p>Escobar eventually became involved in many criminal activities with Oscar Benel Aguirre, with the duo running
            petty street scams, selling contraband cigarettes, fake lottery tickets, and stealing cars.[16] In the early
            1970s, prior to entering the drug trade, Escobar acted as a thief and bodyguard, allegedly earning
            US$100,000 by kidnapping and holding a Medellín executive for ransom.[17] Escobar began working for Alvaro
            Prieto, a contraband smuggler who operated around Medellín, aiming to fulfill a childhood ambition to have
            COL $1 million by the time he was 22.[18] Escobar is known to have had a bank deposit of COL $100 million
            (more than US$3 million), when he turned 26.</p>
        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>Sixteen months after his escape from La Catedral, Pablo Escobar died in a shootout on 2 December 1993, amid
            another of Escobar's attempts to elude the Search Bloc.[46] A Colombian electronic surveillance team, led by
            Brigadier Hugo Martínez,[47] used radio trilateration technology to track his radiotelephone transmissions
            and found him hiding in Los Olivos, a middle-class barrio in Medellín. With authorities closing in, a
            firefight with Escobar and his bodyguard, Álvaro de Jesús Agudelo (alias "El Limón"), ensued. The two
            fugitives attempted to escape by running across the roofs of adjoining houses to reach a back street, but
            both were shot and killed by Colombian National Police.[9] Escobar suffered gunshots to the leg and torso,
            and a fatal gunshot through the ear.</p>
        <p>It has never been proven who actually fired the final shot into his ear, or determined whether this shot was
            made during the gunfight or as part of a possible execution, with wide speculation remaining regarding the
            subject. Some of Escobar's relatives believe that he had committed suicide.[10][48] His two brothers,
            Roberto Escobar and Fernando Sánchez Arellano, believe that he shot himself through the ear. In a statement
            regarding the topic, the duo stated that Pablo "had committed suicide, he did not get killed. During all the
            years they went after him, he would say to me every day that if he was really cornered without a way out, he
            would 'shoot himself through the ear'.</p>
